  "body": "# RepoXplorer\r\n\r\nRepoXplorer is a small stats and charts utility for GIT repositories.\r\nIts main purpose is to ease the visualization of stats for one or\r\nmore projects.\r\n\r\nAs lot of projects are composed of multiple sub-projects (server, client,\r\nlibraries). RepoXplorer let's you define how a project is composed and\r\nthen compute stats across multiple sub-projects.\r\n\r\nFurthermore it is possible to define author identities by listing\r\nauthor' emails and then avoid duplicated author in computed stats.\r\n\r\nRepoXplorer rely on ElasticSearch and Pecan. Once the service is\r\nstarted only a web browser is needed to access the user interface.\r\n\r\n## How to install\r\n\r\nFirst install repoxplorer in a virtualenv.\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\nvirtualenv ~/repoxplorer\r\n. ~/repoxplorer/bin/activate\r\npip install -r requirements.txt\r\npython setup.py install\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstall Elasticsearch. Here we use an already \"ready to use\" Docker\r\ncontainer.\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\n~/repoxplorer/bin/el-start.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nStart the RepoXplorer web app.\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\nuwsgi --http-socket :8080 --pecan ~repoxplorer/local/share/repoxplorer/config.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Index a project\r\n\r\nA yaml file should be provisioned with the projects you want to index. The\r\nfile $prefix/local/share/repoxplorer/projects.yaml is expected to be found.\r\n\r\nBelow is the default projects.yaml files provided. Note that Barbican project\r\nis composed of two sub-projects: the server and the client.\r\n\r\nEdit this file to add projects you want to index.\r\n~repoxplorer/local/share/repoxplorer/projects.yaml.\r\n\r\n```YAML\r\n---\r\n- Barbican:\r\n   - name: barbican\r\n     uri: https://github.com/openstack/barbican\r\n     branch: master\r\n   - name: python-barbicanclient\r\n     uri: https://github.com/openstack/python-barbicanclient\r\n     branch: master\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen start the GIT indexer manually or configure CRON job. The indexer\r\nwill read the projects.yaml file and will index project' commits in the\r\nElasticSearch DB.\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\npython ~repoxplorer/bin/repoxplorer-indexer\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Sanitize author identities\r\n\r\nIn the example below all contributions for John Doe will be stacked if\r\nthe author email field of the GIT commit object is one of the defined\r\nemails.\r\n\r\nEdit ~repoxplorer/local/share/repoxplorer/idents.yaml\r\n\r\n```YAML\r\n---\r\n- name: John Doe\r\n  emails:\r\n    - john.doe@server\r\n    - jdoe@server\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Run tests\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\ntox\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\n\r\nRepoXplorer is new and should be considered Alpha ! Feel free to help !\r\nLook at the feature requests list on the Github issue tracker.\r\n",
